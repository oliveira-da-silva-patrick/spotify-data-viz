# Spotify Genre Management Exploration
This project wants to discover how Spotify manages genres and explore ideas how it could be improved

## Potential Issues
When running the setup.qmd file, it may not run because my Spotify ID is being used.
However, if it runs, I would not run it as the following plots are based on the top artists on my Spotify account.
They may have changed in-between which would maybe cause the plots to not work anymore.
If this does happen, just change the artist name that is being filtered on to an artist that is present in the new top
and everything should be all right.

Other important info is that since the latest R Studio update, I had to change all my relative paths. My editor
thinks the root folder of the project is the /src folder and no longer the actual root folder. Please excuse me,
if this issue is not on your side and you end up needing to maybe remove the '../' in the differen filepaths in the code.
